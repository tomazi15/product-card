## Overview

The challenge was to create a simple product card that has two break points:

- Mobile: 375px
- Desktop: 1440px

The task was a nice little challenge to get my self started with Frontend Mentor, but there were some challenges, one of which was the fact that I
have never used either Tailwind Css or Styled Components to deliver anything.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements (Button only)

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I have learned a good amount of Tailwind and the class names. I have also learned Styled Components, But the biggest achievement was that i was able to
connect the two technologies using twin macro.
